intro: |
  With <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank">2 billion users worldwide</a>, Instagram is particularly easy to get addicted to.

  Instagram addiction happens when the app starts **replacing your normal activities** like hanging out with friends or enjoying hobbies. It's not black and white; you might be mildly, moderately, or severely hooked.

  Although <a href="https://help.instagram.com/2049425491975359" target="_blank">Instagram has built-in features to control screen time</a>, they aren't the most effective.

  You can also use SpeedBump to restrict other addictive apps like [TikTok](/en/app/tiktok-addiction/), YouTube, or Twitter. Here's how it works:
