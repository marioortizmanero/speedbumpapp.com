SpeedBump hasn't collected any data other than crash reports.

I wanted to be wary of privacy, and collecting data wouldn't be that helpful anyway. A small user base means a small amount of data, which can be misleading or not that useful.

Having anonymized data genuinely helps improve the app:

* You can do A/B tests. Some users will see one version of the app, and others another one. You measure which one is most performant, and choose that one.
* You can find out issues. For example, what's the % of users who are getting stuck in the permissions screen? If it's too high, it means something's probably wrong.
