# Chronically Online: How to Set Limits on Social Media

## Why You Need to Limit Social Media in 2025

Completely quitting social media is unrealistic for many -- especially younger generations. Platforms like Instagram or TikTok can be genuinely useful to connect with others, but it's easy to get hooked. We've all been there: a friend shares a Reel or YouTube video, taking you into an hour-long rabbit hole of cats dancing to Shakira. Can we find balance between being "chronically online" and becoming a buddhist monk?

It turns out that taking action isn't that hard. Having spent countless hours on the topic, I've collected over 40 ideas to reduce your screen time.

## Understand the Why

Start by understanding **why** you use your phone even though you don't want to:

* Boredom
* Anxiety
* Procrastination
* Muscle memory

Spending time on social media is okay! Not just to connect, but also for coping. We're human, and getting our mind off a problem can relieve stress to tackle it later. In a study on Twitch livestreams helping people through tough times, 82% found them at least somewhat helpful.

Having that in mind, we all reach a point where being online is counterproductive. It depends, but deep inside you'll know when that happens.

## Changing your Mindset

Most importantly, **change your perspective from "using your phone less" to "doing something else more"**. What would you rather do than scroll on social media? Make a list of 5 items:

* Sports: join a running club
* Hanging out with friends: meet regularly every Tuesday
* Reading: make a whishlist
* Calling loved ones: set recurring alarms
* Exploring new hobbies: get a pottery set, learn video editing, or dust off that retro camera on the shelf

Don't start doing them all at once or build unrealistic expectations. Start with small goals like simply showing up to an activity, and take it from there.

## Tools to Reduce Screen Time

Tools are a useful band-aid while you tackle the root cause. Especially because "tackling the root cause" might be an endless task, so every bit helps. The following ideas will add friction to addictive apps, remind you that maybe it's been too long, and keep you accountable.

### Built-in Screen Time Features

You might not know it, but both Android and iOS come with powerful features to reduce phone usage:

* **iOS Screen Time** (available since iOS 12):
  1. Open Settings on your iPhone, iPad, or MacBook
  2. Look for "Screen Time"
  3. Features: analyze your usage patterns, set focus time (downtime), add app limits. Advanced features include "always allowed" apps or "screen distance".
* **Android Digital Wellbeing** (available since 2018):
  1. Open Settings on your smartphone or tablet
  2. Look for "Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls"
  3. Features: analyze your usage patterns, set timers for apps, or specify a screen time goal. In my experience, advanced ones like "screen time while walking" or "driving monitor" consume battery but don't work that well.

Built-in timers are convenient but can be easy to bypass; the button to extend the timer is so easy to tap! Additional options like Focus Mode, Bedtime or Sleep Mode, or Do Not Disturb can enhance effectiveness. Experiment with them to see what works best for your usage patterns: ADHD, doomscrolling, unlocking your phone too frequently, or procrastinating.

### Advanced Built-In Screen Time Features

For those seeking more robust solutions, both operating systems offer advanced customization:

* **iOS Shortcuts** for social media control:
  * Launch the "Shortcuts" app on your iOS device
  * Tap the "+" icon to create a new automation
  * Ideas: send a notification after 10 minutes of usage, or toggle Focus Mode in the office
* **Samsung's Modes and Routines** (for other Android brands, the third party app Tasker, which is paid):
  * Go to Settings > "Modes and Routines" > "Routines"
  * Tap the "+" icon to create a new routine
  * Ideas: enable Do Not Disturb at night, or always close YouTube or Netflix during work hours

Unfortunately, these features can be tricky to configure, and are limited to certain manufacturers. They aren't specific to screen time, so your experience may not be the smoothest.

### Third-Party Timer Apps

The App Store and Play Store offer many effective app timers and blockers:

<div class="third-party-apps">
{%- for app in third_party_apps %}
  <div class="card">
    <img eleventy:widths="100" src="{{ app.image }}" alt="{{ app.name }}'s logo">
    <h4>{{ app.title | markdownify }}</h4>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>{{ app.description | markdownify }}</p>
      <p><b>Best for</b>: {{ app.best_for | markdownify }}</p>
      <p>💰 <i style="opacity: 0.8;">{{ app.pricing | markdownify }}</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
{%- endfor %}
</div>

### Digital Detox Tips Beyond Timers

Consider these additional strategies:

1. **Notification management**: disable non-essential notifications. Try changing from notifications to emails; that way, you can check them later, possibly from your computer at home.
2. **App layout organization**: move social apps off your home screen, hide them in folders, or install a minimal launcher.
3. **Grayscale mode**: enable during evening hours to reduce visual stimulation.
4. **Physical boundaries**: create phone-free zones in your home. Can you leave your phone outside your room before going to bed? Take a walk leaving your phone at home -- how does it feel? Embrace the discomfort and get used to it.
5. **Newsletters**: there are services that aggregate what happened over the week on your favorite websites. Instead of checking every few minutes, subscribe to one of them for a weekly summary. You'll realize that you aren't missing out on much.
6. **Do less on your phone**: print documents or read them on your ebook. Buy a newspaper (yes, in 2025!) instead of using the news app. Replace your notes app with a real notepad, spend money on a vinyl player instead of Spotify, or uninstall Amazon and visit a store next time.
7. **App-specific settings**: did you know that TikTok and Instagram have built-in Screen Time options? They aren't the best, but you can give them a try. Even the tech forum "Hacker News" has a "noprocrast" option (i.e., "no procrastination") in your profile.
8. **Use the browser instead of the app**: the sub-optimal experience might prevent mindless scrolling.
9. **Get used to being bored**: it's actually good for you -- your creativity will increase. Can you manage to stare at your wall for a measly 15 minutes?
10. **Going nuclear**: if you really need a break, try uninstalling -- even if temporarily -- or getting a dumbphone. A less well-known alternative to dumbphones is a smartwatch with a SIM card.

## Conclusion: Take it Slow and Experiment

Combining multiple strategies consistently over time works best. The first two weeks are typically the most challenging, but continuing for 3-4 weeks helps develop sustainable habits. It takes persistence, but the benefits to your productivity and wellbeing are worth the initial effort!

Remember that platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, and Reddit employ thousands of engineers specifically to maximize your engagement. Feeling challenged when limiting usage is normal -- these apps are designed to be addictive. Changing your perspective and setting boundaries will help you focus on what truly matters in your life.

This article lists enough ideas -- now it's up to you to take action. Don't just save a link or leave it for later. Write a list of a few you'd like to try, place it on your bathroom's mirror, and track how well they're working for you. If you know someone with similar problems, share this article with them!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I completely block social media apps instead of just timing them?

A: Yes, both built-in features and third-party apps offer complete blocking options. For example, you can block them during your working hours. Look for "App Block" in iOS' Screen Time or "Focus Mode" in Android's Digital Wellbeing.

### Q: Do social media timers work for desktop usage too?

A: iOS's Screen Time, Opal, or ScreenZen share your data across Apple devices by default, including macOS, iPad, and iPhone. Most third-party solutions offer browser extensions for desktop. Browser-specific extensions like StayFocusd (Chrome) or LeechBlock (Firefox) are also effective.

### Q: Will using timers affect my notifications?

A: It depends on the solution. Most timers will block notifications during restricted periods, though emergency notifications typically remain active.

### Q: What's the recommended daily limit for social media?

A: It largely depends on personal and professional requirements. Digital wellness experts suggest 30 to 60 minutes per day for better mental wellbeing. Ideally, they should be broken into shorter sections rather than continuous scrolling.

### Q: Can I set different limits for weekdays versus weekends?

A: Yes, most solutions including iOS Screen Time, Android Digital Wellbeing, and third-party apps offer day-specific scheduling.

### Q: What is 'chronically online' or 'terminally online'?

A: Someone chronically online is a person who is isolated due to excessive internet use. They may be out of touch with reality and give major importance to Internet culture.
