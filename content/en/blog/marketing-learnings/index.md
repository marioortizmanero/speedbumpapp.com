[I'm building SpeedBump]({{ '/blog/v1' | locale_url }}), an intentionally annoying app to get you off the phone. But after two months of work, it's hard to find a definitive answer to "should I continue working on this?". So I gave marketing a try; follow me in my path of fails as a first-time founder.

Opportunity cost is a problem -- maybe another project would be more worthy of my time. So I started spreading the word about SpeedBump; if people like it enough, that's a good signal! I think.

## Define a market, you dummy!

My first mistake was not clearly defining a market. By default, I assumed my target audience was in the US because it's the fast track:

- 300M people speaking the same language and sharing a similar culture.
- iPhone is a majority, and its users tend to spend more money on apps than Android.
- Building a prototype on Android is a pain.

In reality, targeting the United States brought me headaches:

* The first version of SpeedBump is for Android because it's what I already knew. Mysteriously, [the iOS waitlist](https://forms.gle/HoBqN2URBBnBpva46) was increasing, but not the Play Store installations.
* It took me a while to realize, but living in Germany my TikToks aren't shown to the US. Europeans understand English but prefer their native language for day-to-day content.

So I pivoted to targeting Germany, where I live, and Spain, where I'm from. These countries have an Android market share of 61% and 76%, respectively. This gives me a higher chance to users actually downloading the app.

I quickly realized you can't just "quickly dip your toes in marketing", though. It's time consuming -- especially working alone -- and a new skill for me.

## Launching

An easy way to get some eyes on your product is to launch on sites like [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). Each day, this platform lists new products, and people get to vote on which ones they like most.

It felt crazy to compete against teams developing super cool things like AR glasses. All while the banner I used for the launch looked like it was done by a kid on MS Paint from 2003. For real, look at it:

<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/speedbump" target="_blank">![Make Social Media Annoying](/en/blog/marketing-learnings/product_hunt_banner.png)</a>

But impressively, SpeedBump managed to end up 7th of a random Tuesday in March! The site didn't get *that* much traffic, so I stressed out unnecessarily. It's a mostly-US platform, which I'm not directly targeting, but served as a signal that people do like the project.

Their Twitter account also highlighted SpeedBump, with a quote I liked:

<a href="https://x.com/ProductHunt/status/1897210505183576167" target="_blank">![This app is like paying a Gen-Z intern to annoy you so you spend less time on your phone.](/en/blog/marketing-learnings/product_hunt_tweet.png)</a>

I also tried [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) to no avail -- does anyone actually use that site?

## SEO

SEO is the art of making your website appear first in Google. It's well established, so it was easy to do the basics. Plus, identifying what terms people use to find your problem is useful beyond SEO.

However, people use more than one search engine, such as the Play Store and social media like TikTok. The concepts are similar, but the tools vary and their search terms differ.

[My personal blog](https://nullderef.com/) taught me the importance of SEO. Sure, launching an article (or product) will get you a spike of views. But what keeps the blog alive is the keyword "rust plugin system", which people keep searching for. It's rather long-term and "do once and forget".

Not wanting to raise investor money, I'm also stingy. And holy crap is SEO expensive!

Free tools including Google Keyword Planner only go so far, unfortunately. Ahrefs' Starter plan at $29/month ran out of credits after a single afternoon. But Semrush has a powerful free trial, so that worked out better.

The best resources I found were [Ilias Ism's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@illyism) and [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/). Ilias has videos where he roasts websites, so I'd go like "crap, I'm also messing that up". Backlinko has high-quality articles that go into detail about SEO.

## Viral marketing

This was a huge rabbit hole! Ironically, I've never used social media more than when building an app to reduce social media usage. There's a lot of irony in this project.

My strategy is heavily influenced by the fact that SpeedBump has no followers anywhere. I'd upload a Reel to Instagram and literally get 0 views. My personal account helped a bit, along with my LinkedIn followers. But they aren't necessarily the perfect user for SpeedBump.

So I ended up using TikTok a lot, where you don't need followers at all. A new account can easily get a viral video. It's incredibly common to promote your products on TikTok -- on the opposite end of Reddit, where I struggled to share anything, even if it was in the interest of the community.

YouTube Shorts is similar; it's just longer-term. Which is what I love about YouTube. Today, my feed suggested me a 17-year old video titled "Worlds fastest smoker". Pure gold, honestly. This is what I come to the Internet for.

Posting to over 6 platforms initially was a huge mess without a specialized tool. For now, I've simplified my life and dropped Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. I just post on TikTok, and repost it on YouTube Shorts. When I get more traction (and money), I can consider other platforms.

By the way, it's insane that even LinkedIn has now a TikTok-like feed. Like feverish-dream kind of insane.

My favorite resource to learn how to do TikToks has been ["Money Mind Unfiltered"](https://www.youtube.com/@moneymindunfiltered). Very transparent guy with deep dives on how he does short-form videos himself.

Side question: does anyone use hashtags anymore?

## What's next

No regrets about learning marketing, given that I've learned a ton. But it hasn't helped me know whether to continue working on SpeedBump.

I've realized I was asking myself the wrong thing. Instead, it should be: "does this make for a good enough business?".

Even if that wasn't the case, I'd keep SpeedBump as a side project just because it's so fun and useful. But my goal after all is to make a living. Coming next: how to do that. Might take another while.
