An issue I've had with screen time apps is that they're hard to configure.

SpeedBump only asks you what apps are addictive to you. When you open one of them, it asks you how long you want to stay.

So it requires one single step.

But we could take it even further!

What if the shield *always* appeared? You unlock your phone, and have to estimate how long you want to use it for, regardless of the app.

How important is it to make the app simple anyway? The biggest friction is getting people to actually install the app anyway.
