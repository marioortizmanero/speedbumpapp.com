[I blasted over a speed bump](/en/blog/launch/), as a metaphor for the app I'm building. It worked well enough, but the idea

Here are all the different translations I came across:

* Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung: suggested by Google Translate. It's actually wrong and means "speed limit".
* Bodenschwelle: suggested by Claude AI. It means ground bump.
* Temposchwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrlgf2/). It means speed/rate bump.
* Bremsschwelle: sugested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrl7jo/).
* RÃ¼ttelschwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrl7jo/).
