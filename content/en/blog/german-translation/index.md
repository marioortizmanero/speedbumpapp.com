Here are all the different translations I came across:

1. Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung: suggested by Google Translate. It's completely wrong and means "speed limit".
2. Bodenschwelle: suggested by Claude AI. It means "ground bump" and is not used, according to locals.

4. Temposchwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrlgf2/). It means speed/rate bump.

6. Rüttelschwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrl7jo/). This is what appears in dictionaries (["Duden"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duden)).
7. Bremsbückel: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrli58/).
8. Schwelle: suggested on Wikipedia as the most popular term in Austria.
