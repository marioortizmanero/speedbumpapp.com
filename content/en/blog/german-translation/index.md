[I blasted over a speed bump](/en/blog/launch/), as a metaphor for the app I'm building. It worked well enough, but the idea

Here are all the different translations I came across:

1. Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung: suggested by Google Translate. It's completely wrong and means "speed limit".
2. Bodenschwelle: suggested by Claude AI. It means "ground bump" and is not used, according to locals.
3. Fahrbahnschwelle: suggested by DeepL. It means "roadway swell" and is more common.
4. Temposchwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrlgf2/). It means speed/rate bump.
5. Bremsschwelle: sugested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrl7jo/). According to Wikipedia, this is a broader term.
6. Rüttelschwelle: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrl7jo/). This is what appears in dictionaries (["Duden"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duden)).
7. Bremsbückel: suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrli58/).
8. Schwelle: suggested on Wikipedia as the most popular term in Austria.
9. Geschwindigkeitshügel: another term mentioned on Wikipedia.
10. Kreissegmentschwellen: another term mentioned on Wikipedia.
11. Moabiter Kissen: in Moabit, Germany (Wikipedia). It's a neighbourhood of Berlin.
12. Krefelder Kissen: in Krefeld, Germany (Wikipedia).
13. Berliner Kissen: in Berlin, Germany (Wikipedia).
14. Kölner Teller: in Cologne, Germany (Wikipedia).
15. Delfter Hügel: in Delft, Netherlands (Wikipedia).
16. schlafender/liegender Polizist: a joke with Italian origin referring to speed bumps being lying-down policemen. This is also used in other languages such as English (sleeping policemen) or Spanish (policía tumbado).
17. Ralentisseur: taken from French, so probably more common in the borders of Germany.
18. Speedbump: taken from English; most young people are familiar with it.

Some people also confuse them with pot holes, which are Schlagloch. Also Hubbel or Hückel, suggested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2gryv/comment/mfrracd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Lesson learned: get a proper translation service -- even AI doesn't work well enough. Or without budget, try asking a friend.

Even with proper translation, the country's culture might make it irrelevant, though. It turns out speed bumps aren't all that popular in Germany -- in Munich, they were
