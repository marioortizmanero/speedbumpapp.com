My goal with SpeedBump has always been to make screen time accessible. Similar to Duolingo, they make education available for anyone.

At the same time, I need money. Not just for myself, but also to grow the business. Promoting your app costs money, but making your app more known is precisely how you make it accessible. Building something and waiting for everyone isn't perfect -- it takes a very long time and hits limits.

TODO: look at reviews of other apps and see what people say about it being paid.

## Subscriptions: the Bad Guys

Everyone's tired of subscriptions -- they're everywhere.

Truth is, they work.

### Hibernating subscriptions

- Kagi does this
- https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/auto-hibernate-subscriptions/

### Community subscriptions

- Finch does this

## Pay Once

- Works for some features, but others have ongoing server costs.

## My Dream: Well-Integrated Ads

- NordVPN logo with memes like dancing cats
