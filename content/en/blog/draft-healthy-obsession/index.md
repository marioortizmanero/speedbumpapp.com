Being obsessed is commonly said to be essential for entrepreneurship. I agree.

Holy crap was I wrong about [this quote](https://nullderef.com/blog/phone-jan25/):

> Surprisingly, it’s less stressful. I’m definitely speaking too early, given that my user count is 0. But having control over my schedule gives me peace of mind. The routine feels similar because I still have to do things I don’t like. But the product I’m striving towards is fulfilling, and that makes up for it.

## Disconnecting

My conscious mind works differently from my thoughts. I'm trying to sleep, but have lots of thoughts about the startup.

I don't want to, so I tell myself to shut up. That never works: the thoughts come again and again.

The "solution" was to embrace my thoughts by writing them down. Which is partly why I write here.

This idea came to me reading "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl (applying his *logotherapy* to myself).

## Office

TODO

## Bad sleep

Here's a particularly bad example: I went to sleep once and my mind wouldn't stop thinking about the startup.

I wrote my thoughts, which helped me finally fall asleep.

Mid-dream I literally woke up because I had a TikTok idea.

What the fuck.

Like, I was hanging out with friends while sleeping, and -- boom, gone.

To be fair, it's an awesome idea. But still

## Distractions

I literally fixed a bug while swimming.

It wasn't a minor bug, either. The website wasn't working at all for anyone whose browser wasn't in English, Spanish, or German.

## So what?

Entrepreneurship has always been in my TODO list, and this was the #1 fear holding me back.

But it's okay because I'm doing this at the best moment possible. Now that I've lived this, it sounds impossible to try to do it with responsabilities like a morgage or kids.

It reminds me of a statistic pointing out that older folks are more likely to succeed with entrepreneurship than young ones. (TODO link). The bias is that if you can afford taking the risk while young. But if you're an older founder, you better be sure it's a good idea.
