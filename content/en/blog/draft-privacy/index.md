I'm building SpeedBump, an [intentionally annoying app to break doomscrolling](/en/). Such apps need access to the apps you open and use at all times, so I've been wary about privacy. Thus, SpeedBump doesn't collect **any** data other than crash reports.

## Prototypes don't need to collect data

Collecting data (_quantitative_) is actually discouraged for prototypes. New products should focus on asking people through surveys, calls, and conversations (_qualitative_).

For example, I'd rather hear from a user that the app is too annoying than to figure it out by looking at data. Why?

1. Prototypes don't have many users. Analyzing data based on a user base of 30 is not a good idea.
2. People's stories are anecdotal, but they give you more information. When I talk with people, they share their opinion on phone addiction in general, what methods they tried, what worked and what didn't, and much more.

Thanks to qualitative data, [I discovered that my app sucked](/en/blog/v1/) at first. No code needed, just a survey and some chats.

## Collecting data actually helps improve the app

However, as your user count grows, anonymized data can be genuinely helpful.

With just qualitative data, you're limited to being reactive rather than proactive. You can detect bugs instead of waiting for someone to complain. And users rarely complain because they have other things to do -- they'll just uninstall.

This data also enables you to optimize the app. How should I know if people use their phones less when I force them to take a 10-minute break versus a 15-minute one? You try both versions on randomized groups of users and look at their average screen time -- an A/B test.

## What kind of data collection is intrusive?

So far, I talked about anonymized data.

## Do users care?

In reality, the majority don't care enough -- they just want to use the app.

Privacy-wary users are a loud minority. It depends on the industry, but TODO study.

## Privacy policies of other screen time apps

As research, I read the privacy policy of the 6 most popular screen time apps. I promise I didn't just feed it to an LLM; this was a pain.

No apps state that they sell your data, but it could still end up in the hands of others:

* Through **business transfers**: if [Meta buys Opal](/en/blog/opal-bought-by-meta/), then Meta owns its data.
* Within **associates**: Clearspace had a broad definition for with whom they may share data:

  ![Affiliates.Â We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.](clearspace-affiliates.png)

* Due to a **security compromise**: no system is 100% secure, which Opal, BePresent and Clearspace mention (good!):

  ![Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however](opal-security.png)

Given how complex and ambiguous the policies are, instead of saying "app X is bad", I can:

* Point out red flags ðŸš©. The apps could clarify ambiguous statements as a response to this post -- I don't mean to shame anyone.
* List what data the company collects, which would be at risk in the cases above.

In theory, screen time apps on iOS don't have access to data about the apps you use. When you start blocking an app, Apple gives developers an encrypted token, which they can use to set up limits. But at no point do they know *what* app you're blocking.

TODO: image

Clearspace works around this limitation by simply asking the user what app they just blocked. I'm not sure why they do this or if it's allowed, though.
