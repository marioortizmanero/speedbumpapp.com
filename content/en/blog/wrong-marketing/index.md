I'm building SpeedBump, an app to get you off the phone. After two months of work, I haven't found a definitive answer to "should I continue working on this?".

## Marketing

I tried to find an answer by spreading the word. If I show the app and people like it enough, that's a good signal! I think.

My major mistake was not defining a clear market. By default, I assumed that was the US because it seemed easier. It's a fast track:

- 300M people speaking the same language and with a very similar culture.
- There's basically an iPhone monopoly, which is easier to develop for than Android.
- iPhone users tend to spend more money on apps than Android.

In reality, targeting the US brought me major headaches:

* There's basically an Apple monopoly in the US, but the first version of my app is for Android.
* I live in Germany, so my TikToks aren't seen in the US. Even they understand English here, most prefer German for day-to-day content.

So I pivoted to targeting Germany, where I live, and Spain, where I'm from. These countries have an [Android market share of 61% and 76%, respectively](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/). Unlike US' 38%, I'd have a higher chance that users actually download the app.

I quickly realized you can't just "quickly dip your toes in marketing", though. It's time consuming -- especially as a solo founder -- and a new skill for me.

### Launching

An easy way to get some first eyes on your product is to launch on Product Hunt. Each day, this platform lists new products, and people get to vote on which ones they like most.

It was pretty crazy to compete with people who developed super cool AR glasses. All while the banner I used for the launch looked like it was done by a kid on MS Paint from 2003. For real, look at it:

But impressively, SpeedBump managed to get 7th on a random Tuesday of March! The site didn't get *that* much traffic, so I stressed out unnecessarily. Even if I knew that it's a mostly-US platform -- which I'm not targeting -- I guess it's a signal that people do like the project.

Their Twitter account also highlighted SpeedBump, with a quote I liked:

I tried IndieHackers to no avail -- is anyone actually using that site? At some point I'll also use Hacker News, but it's the same story with being US centered.

### SEO

SEO -- the art of making your website appear first in Google -- is well established, so it was easy to do the basics. But it's not just Google that I need to focus on: also the Play Store and social media like TikTok. The concepts are similar, but the tools vary and people search very different things on each platform.

Being bootstrapped, I'm also very stingy to pay for many tools. And holy crap is SEO expensive!

ahrefs offers some free tools for keyword research, i.e., what words people use when they Google, so that you can use them too. I was doing this but it was a bad idea because paying gives you an amazing amount of resources. It's crazy how advanced SEO is.

My joy lasted for a short time until I ran out of the 50 credits I paid 30 euros for, though. In a single afternoon.

### Viral marketing

This was a huge rabbit hole! Ironically, I've never used social media more than when building an app to reduce social media usage. There's a lot of irony in this project.

My strategy is heavily influenced by the fact that SpeedBump has no followers anywhere. I'd upload a Reel to Instagram and literally get 0 views. My personal account helped a bit, along with my LinkedIn followers. But they aren't necessarily the perfect user for SpeedBump.

So I ended up using TikTok a lot, where you don't need followers at all. A new account can easily get a viral video. It's incredibly common to promote your products on TikTok -- on the opposite end of Reddit, where I struggled to share anything, even if it was in the interest of the community.

YouTube Shorts is similar; it's just longer-term. Which is what I love about YouTube. Today, my feed suggested me a 17-year old 1-minute-lont video titled "worlds fastest smoker". Pure gold, honestly. This is what I come to the Internet for.

Posting to all these platforms was a huge mess without a specialized tool. For now, I've simplified my life and dropped Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. I just post on TikTok, and repost it on YouTube Shorts. When I get more traction (and money), I can consider other platforms.

By the way, it's insane that even LinkedIn has now a TikTok-like feed. Like feverish-dream kind of insane.

Side question: does anyone use hashtags anymore?

## What's next

No regrets about learning marketing (it's insane how much I've learned -- I love it), but it hasn't helped me know whether to continue working on SpeedBump. But I've realized I was asking myself the wrong thing.

It should be: "does this make for a good enough business?". Even if that wasn't the case, I'd keep SpeedBump as a side project just because it's so fun and useful. But my goal after all is to make a living. Coming next: how to do that. Might take another while.
