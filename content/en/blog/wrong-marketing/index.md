I'm building SpeedBump, an app to get you off the phone. After two months of work, I haven't found a definitive answer to "should I continue working on this?".

## Marketing

I tried to find an answer by spreading the word. If I show the app and people like it enough, that's a good signal! I think.

My first mistake was not defining a clear market. By default, I assumed that was the US because it seemed easier. It's a fast track:

- 300M people speaking the same language and with a very similar culture.
- There's basically an iPhone monopoly, which is easier to develop for than Android.
- iPhone users tend to spend more money on apps than Android.

In reality, targeting the US brought me major headaches:

* There's basically an Apple monopoly in the US, but the first version of my app is for Android.
* I live in Germany, so my TikToks aren't seen in the US. Even they understand English here, most prefer German for day-to-day content.

So I pivoted to targeting Germany, where I live, and Spain, where I'm from. These countries have an [Android market share of 61% and 76%, respectively](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/). Unlike US' 38%, I'd have a higher chance that users actually download the app.

I quickly realized you can't just "quickly dip your toes in marketing", though. It's time consuming -- especially as a solo founder -- and a new skill for me. My learnings are:

- SEO (i.e., the art of making your website appear first in Google) is well established, so it was easy to do the basics. But it's not just Google that I need to focus: also the Play Store and social media like TikTok. The concepts are similar, but the tools vary and people search very different things on each platform.

## Success

* TikTok is awesome for new companies. You don't even need followers to get some initial views. If the video is liked by enough people during a random trial, it will get more and more shared. It also seems pretty common to promote products even if it's not an ad.
* LinkedIn has been useful since the beginning because I had a decent following. But they are people I personally know, who aren't necessarily the best target for my product. Haven't tried their new video format.
* Product Hunt: unexpectedly, SpeedBump ended up seventh on March 4! Very stressful, but no regrets. I did expect more traffic on the site and less spam in my inbox. Maybe top 5 would have been better for that. It's also very US-focused, but I guess it helps with the SEO and to get some validation. It added ~1 point in domain ranking.
* YouTube Shorts has worked pretty well. It just takes much more time than TikTok to get some views.

I've gone from "website authority" of 0.7 to 2.4.

## Failure

* Reddit users are incredibly skeptical of promotions, even if they're in the subreddit's interest.
* Is anyone actually using IndieHackers? I'll consider myself lucky if I get more than 3 votes.
* On X, Mastodon, BlueSky, and Instagram, you need some initial followers to get traction. I haven't found out how to do it properly on Instagram yet, but Communities on Twitter have helped me go from 0 likes to 1 (I had to get the app instead of the browser).
* Hacker News is hard because your post is given only a couple minutes to gain traction. It's also strictly English-speaking and US-centered. So far, they're too serious for this app.

Does anyone even use hashtags anymore?
