SpeedBump is in a decent enough state after [its second version](/en/blog/v1/). It's an app to help reduce phone usage. But after two months of work, I'm still not sure it's a good idea. Before polishing the new user experience, it should go through a bit of validation. So I got started with marketing:

My first mistake had to do with localization. By default, I was targeting English-speakers, most likely from the US. Just because it was easier and I'm familiar with the culture. In reality, this didn't make sense because my app is Android-only, and you seemingly need to buy an iPhone to be a US citizen. Another big mistake was that I tried to target US while living in Germany. This resulted in, for example, my English-speaking TikToks only being shown to Germans, which is suboptimal.

So I pivoted to targeting Germany and Spain. Android has [a 61% and 76% ratio](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/), which unlike US' 38% gives me higher chances at users actually downloading the app. I know well how these countries work, and can speak the language (well, German kind of). And I didn't see other big companies doing this kind of product in Spanish or German.

It's been interesting to discover how different each social media is:

## Success

* TikTok is awesome for new companies. You don't even need followers to get some initial views. If the video is liked by enough people during a random trial, it will get more and more shared. It also seems pretty common to promote products even if it's not an ad.
* LinkedIn has been useful since the beginning because I had a decent following. But they are people I personally know, who aren't necessarily the best target for my product. Haven't tried their new video format.
* Product Hunt: unexpectedly, SpeedBump ended up seventh on March 4! Very stressful, but no regrets. I did expect more traffic on the site and less spam in my inbox. Maybe top 5 would have been better for that. It's also very US-focused, but I guess it helps with the SEO and to get some validation. It added ~1 point in domain ranking.
* YouTube Shorts has worked pretty well. It just takes much more time than TikTok to get some views.

## Failure

* Reddit users are incredibly skeptical of promotions, even if they're in the subreddit's interest.
* Is anyone actually using IndieHackers? I'll consider myself lucky if I get more than 3 votes.
* On X, Mastodon, BlueSky, and Instagram, you need some initial followers to get traction. I haven't found out how to do it properly on Instagram yet, but Communities on Twitter have helped me go from 0 likes to 1.
* Hacker News is hard because your post is given only a couple minutes to gain traction. It's also strictly English-speaking and US-centered. So far, they're too serious for this app.
