      <p>Start with <b>self-compassion</b>. Doomscrolling is what happens when tech companies optimize every detail to keep you hooked. Negative news worsen the problem; media thrives on alarming and controversial content because it grabs attention. Feeling challenged when limiting usage is normal – these apps are <i>designed</i> to be addictive.</p>
      <p>Social media can still be useful to learn and connect with others. So it's all about setting boundaries, and achieving a more <b>conscious usage</b>. Checking a message from a friend but getting stuck for an hour shouldn't be the norm.</p>
      <p>Building habits takes time. <b>SpeedBump gives you that push</b> while you try to take control again. After a two-week streak, you'll find yourself aware of your usage and spending more time on things you truly enjoy.</p>
